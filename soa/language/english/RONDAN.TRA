@1   = ~Well, fellow Banites it seems we won't have to go looking for a sacrifice after all, the sacrifice has come to us. Our lord Bane will be most pleased with such a generous offering.~
@2   = ~The only sacrifice made here today will be yourself. Did you think you could simply take the stone without a fight? You will soon suffer the same fate as Bane himself.... Death.~
@3   = ~Dead or not Banes followers grow each day. We simply await his return. Even now we feel his presence. The elven stone will spread his influence throughout the Sword Coast and beyond. Your suffering and that of countless others will add to his power.~
@4   = ~Enough of this talk, only one of us is leaving here with the stone and it's not going to be you!~
@5   = ~The stone will never be yours. My Banites will have your head within the hour. It will make a fine trophy for Teldorn. Let us waste no more time. Draw steel!!~
