Stories were told of a Medusa hiding out in a cave in the nearby mountains. As a test of courage, it fell upon Laeroth to deliver the head of such a beast. After conversing with the elders of his village, a bow was crafted to tackle such an enemy. The bow was constructed from weirwood to be faithful to its user and withstand the eye of certain creatures. The journey to Medusa's lair was lengthy. Laeroth found his way deep within the cave using a glowstone. Numerous stone forms, the result of countless failed attempts to capture the beast lined the passageway. Reaching a chamber, Laeroth finally found his prey. Face to face with Medusa, her gaze fell upon him. At first, he was paralyzed to do anything, but with the bow in his hands, the effects of the gaze were neutralized and the fight for dominance began. One bow against another, both adversaries trained on each other. The Medusa fired first and a poisonous arrow lodged in his shoulder, just as the weirwood bow fired its own arrow into the Medusa's head. The monster writhed in pain, but Laeroth drank an antidote to the poison in time to see Medusa's last dying throws. With a steady hand, he approached the creature and severed its head. After returning to his village, the head was placed in a safe place to be used against orcs in times of need. Laeroth traveled in his later years and eventually sold the bow for a large sum of gold.
