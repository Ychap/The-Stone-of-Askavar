'The Medussa's curse'
During the year of the Broken Blade, Laeroth was born. In his younger years, he became a master of the bow and had the best eye for accuracy in his elven village. Stories were told of a Medusa hiding out in a cave in the nearby mountains. As a test of courage, it fell upon Laeroth to deliver the head of such a beast. After conversing with the elders of his village, a bow was crafted to tackle such an enemy. The bow was constructed from weirwood to be faithful to its user and withstand the eye of certain creatures. The journey to Medusa's lair was lengthy. Laeroth found his way deep within the cave using a glowstone. Numerous stone forms, the result of countless failed attempts to capture the beast lined the passageway. Reaching a chamber, Laeroth finally found his prey. Face to face with Medusa, her gaze fell upon him. At first, he was paralyzed to do anything, but with the bow in his hands, the effects of the gaze were neutralized and the fight for dominance began. One bow against another, both adversaries trained on each other. The Medusa fired first and a poisonous arrow lodged in his shoulder, just as the weirwood bow fired its own arrow into the Medusa's head. The monster writhed in pain, but Laeroth drank an antidote to the poison in time to see Medusa's last dying throws. With a steady hand, he approached the creature and severed its head. After returning to his village, the head was placed in a safe place to be used against orcs in times of need. Laeroth traveled in his later years and eventually sold the bow for a large sum of gold.

The primary function of two-handed swords is cleaving mounted knights and breaking up pike formations.

We have finally discovered the location of the lost elven stone. We managed to dig through to an old entrance leading to a underground chamber. Unfortunately my scouts reported hobgoblins in the area so I had to seal the entrance and ward it against intrusion. The stone is definitely in the chamber. Its eerie blue glow was unmistakable. For now the entrance remains undetectable but I am uncertain how long the wards will last. With this letter I have sent you the five talismans that Khelben gave to us. 

I would advise not to travel to the Wood of Sharp Teeth at the moment, for some reason the place is crawling with bandits and hobgoblins. 

Over the next week I shall be travelling to Nashkel. A carnival is taking place so if you need me you can find me there.

For now the entrance remains undetectable but I am uncertain how long the wards will last. Originally I sent you the five talismans that Khelben gave to us but my messenger was killed on-route to Beregost by followers of Bane and the talismans were lost. Hopefully this messenger will get to you. In the mean time I will try to trace the talismans.

It is as we have feared. Teldorn has sent forth his group of mercenaries and is heading south towards the Sword Coast. They left Voonlar only five days ago and by the time you read this message they will be holed up in Dystra's old watch tower. No doubt others will meet them there until further orders are given. The finding of the elven stone and the movement of these mercenaries is no coincidence. Teldorn seeks the stone himself, with it he could change the most good natured of people into evil minded murderers. We cannot allow this to happen. This small army must be stopped before they reach the Wood of Sharp Teeth. I leave this task to you my friend, gather whatever forces you can muster but hurry there is no time to lose.

When casting this spell the priest must picture the faces of his fellow party members clearly and focus on the unity of the group. Upon completion all members in the party are healed 1D8 + 1/level hit points. This works regardless of where the party is in relation to one another. 
Curing is permanent only insofar as the creature does not sustain further damage; caused wounds will heal - or can be cured - just as any normal injury.~

Our spies have discovered the location of the elven stone. The Harpers have been busy lately in the Wood of Sharp Teeth near the old Askavar ruins. I believe they have discovered its location but have sealed the entrance for now. I have sent Cileen to help you get inside the ruins. She should be able to get through any of the wards they have put in place. Andrath and Lelthorn can accompany you, they are very capable fighters and will keep you safe. Once you have discovered the stone make haste and travel back to me. You know where to find me.
