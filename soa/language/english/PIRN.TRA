@1   = ~Well, it seems we have guests once again Talmur. I know why you are here, but you are too late, we have already discovered the location of the elven stone thanks to your Harper friend. She was most generous with the information after a little manipulation of course. You have just missed her glorious death... she was a real screamer.~
@2   = ~You evil bastard!! Give me the talisman and you just might live to see the end of the day.~
@3   = ~I'm in the wrong place at the wrong time. I'll be leaving.~
@4   = ~Fine words indeed, but as you can see I have no fear of such threats. Do you not see my fine Golems before you. You are no match for their strength, they will tear you into little pieces.~
@5   = ~The time for talk is over give me the talisman or die.~
@6   = ~So be it. ATTACK them!!!~
